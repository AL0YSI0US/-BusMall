Codefellows Lab 11 : Create a constructor function that creates an object associated with each product  Create an algorithm that will randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.  For each of the three images, increment its property of times it has been shown by one.  Attach an event listener to the section of the HTML page where the images are going to be displayed.  Once the users ‘clicks’ a product, generate three new products for the user to pick from.
